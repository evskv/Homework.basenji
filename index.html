        <div class="hero-feature"><p>In fact, they do. Like most hounds, Basenjis are very vocal. How(l)ever, unlike with most dogs, one can hardly call it a bark. The unique noise they make can be best described as a yodel. These yodles have mesmerised people even in ancient Egypt, where the breed origitanes from. It may very vell be considered a form of art.</p></div>

        <div class="article-feature">Basenjis often stand on their hind legs, somewhat like a meerkat, by themselves or leaning on something; this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something. They also come in three colors:
        <ol>
      <li>red/white</li>
      <li>black/white</li>
      <li>tricolor</li>
      </ol></div>
        <div class="article">Clever and endearing, these dogs are good companions for the person or family who can stay a step ahead of them. They can adapt to apartment living, and even novice pet parents will find these pups to be great first-timer dogs. Just make sure you can provide enough exercise to meet their high energy levels. Youâ€™ll need to commit to plenty of walks and playtime.Basenji dogs posess wonderful traits:
        <ul>
      <li>alert</li>
      <li>curious</li>
      <li>and reserved with strangers</li>
      </ul></div>
